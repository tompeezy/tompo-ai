## Script 1: "Small Business Owners Are Wasting 20 Hours a Week"

**Hook (first 2 sec):** "If you own a small business, you're probably wasting 20 hours a week and don't even know it."

**Body:** "Think about it — answering the same customer questions over and over, manually booking appointments, sending follow-up emails one by one, updating spreadsheets. All of that? AI can do it for you. Automatically. 24/7. While you sleep."

**CTA:** "Follow me — I show business owners how to automate the boring stuff."

---

## Script 2: "I Built a Chatbot for a Dentist"

**Hook:** "I just built an AI chatbot for a local dentist — here's what happened."

**Body:** "Before: their receptionist spent 3 hours a day answering phone calls and DMs with the same questions — hours, pricing, insurance. Now: the chatbot handles all of it. Books appointments. Answers questions. Sends reminders. The receptionist? She actually has time to help patients in the office now."

**CTA:** "If you run a business and you're drowning in repetitive tasks — DM me."

---

## Script 3: "Stop Hiring. Start Automating."

**Hook:** "Before you hire another employee, watch this."

**Body:** "A new employee costs you $30-40K a year minimum. An AI automation costs you a few hundred bucks — one time. It doesn't call in sick. It doesn't need training. It works 24/7. I'm not saying replace your team — I'm saying stop making them do robot work. Let actual robots do it."

**CTA:** "Link in bio if you want to see what I can automate for your business."

## Script 4: "3 Things AI Can Do for Your Business RIGHT NOW"

**Hook:** "3 things AI can do for your business right now — number 3 is insane."

**Body:** 
"Number 1: Answer every customer message instantly — even at 2 AM.
Number 2: Automatically follow up with leads who didn't respond.
Number 3: Generate your entire week of social media content in 10 minutes."

**CTA:** "Which one do you need most? Comment below."

## Script 5: "The $500 Employee That Never Sleeps"

**Hook:** "What if I told you there's an employee that works 24/7, never complains, and costs $500 — total?"

**Body:** "That's what an AI chatbot is. It sits on your website. Customer has a question at midnight? Answered. Someone wants to book an appointment on Sunday? Done. Lead comes in on a holiday? Captured. Your competitors are sleeping. Your chatbot isn't."

**CTA:** "Follow for more AI automation tips for small business."

## Script 6: "I Saved a Business Owner 15 Hours a Week"

**Hook:** "This business owner was working 60 hours a week. I cut it to 45."

**Body:** "He was manually sending invoices, following up with clients by email, posting on social media by hand, and answering the same 10 questions in his DMs every single day. I automated all of it. Now he leaves work at 4 and actually sees his kids."

**CTA:** "Want the same? Link in bio."

---

## Script 7: "Your Competitors Are Already Using AI"

**Hook:** "If you're not using AI in your business yet, your competitors are."

**Body:** "I'm not trying to scare you, but it's true. The businesses that automate first win. They respond faster, follow up better, and don't drop leads. The ones that don't? They're working harder for less. It's 2026. The tools exist. You just need someone to set them up."

**CTA:** "That's what I do. Follow me."

---

## Script 8: "What Happens When You DM a Business at 11 PM"

**Hook:** "I just DM'd 10 local businesses at 11 PM. Wanna know how many responded?"

**Body:** "Zero. Not one. Every single one of those businesses lost a potential customer — me. You know what would have responded? An AI chatbot. Instantly. With the right answer. And it would have booked me an appointment before I went to a competitor."

**CTA:** "Don't be one of those 10 businesses. Link in bio."

---

## Script 9: "POV: You Just Automated Your Business"

**Hook:** *Phone alarm goes off* "It's Monday morning..."

**CTA:** "Want this? DM me 'automate'."

Chatbots, automated emails, booking systems, social media — all on autopilot. I'm not some big corporation. I'm your neighbor. And I want to help local businesses win."
