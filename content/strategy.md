# Tompo AI — Social Media Funnel Strategy

## The Funnel

```
TikTok/YouTube Shorts (attention) 
    → Instagram (nurture/credibility)
        → Facebook (local trust/community)
            → Website: tompoai.shop (convert)
                → Email: gettompoai@gmail.com (close)
```

## Platform Roles

### TikTok & YouTube Shorts (Top of Funnel)

### Instagram (Middle of Funnel)
- **Purpose:** Build credibility. Show personality. Nurture leads.
- **Content:** Reels (same as TikTok), carousels (tips/how-tos), stories (behind the scenes)
- **Frequency:** 1 reel/day, 2-3 stories/day, 2 carousels/week
- **CTA:** "DM me 'automate'" / link to website

### Facebook Page (Local Trust)
- **Purpose:** Local presence. Proof. Community.
- **Content:** Client results, local business shoutouts, longer educational posts
- **Frequency:** 3-5 posts/week

## Content Pillars (use across all platforms)

1. **"Did You Know?"** — Mind-blowing automation facts (e.g., "A chatbot can handle 80% of customer questions")
2. **"Before & After"** — Show manual process vs. automated process
3. **"Day in the Life"** — Behind the scenes of building automations
4. **"Local Love"** — Shout out Salisbury businesses, tie in how AI could help them
